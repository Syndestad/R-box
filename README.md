**1. Rmarkdown report generator for Dragen QC .fastqc_metrics.csv**

For RNAseq performed on the Illumina NovaSeq6000, one single RNAseq run may contain 70 different samples. Batch aggregating and plotting Quality Control metrics from a sequencing run is very useful to spot samples with low sequencing quality within a single run.
While [multiQC](https://multiqc.info) is an excellent tool for aggregating and visualizing QC metrics, my RNAseq project is run using the Dragen pipeline. Since no Dragen module had yet been implemented when I was processing the samples, I wrote my own version in the form of a Rmarkdown report template. It takes a folder of .fastq_metrics.csv files generated by Dragen, and produces a html report with plots made interactive by plotly.
